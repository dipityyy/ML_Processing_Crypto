News Headlines Sentiment

Use the news api to pull the latest news articles for bitcoin and ethereum and create a DataFrame of sentiment scores for each coin.

Use descriptive statistics to answer the following questions:

Which coin had the highest mean positive score?
Which coin had the highest negative score?
Which coin had the highest positive score?

Tokenizer

In this section, you will use NLTK and Python to tokenize the text for each coin. Be sure to:

Lowercase each word
Remove Punctuation
Remove Stopwords

NGrams and Frequency Analysis

In this section you will look at the ngrams and word frequency for each coin.

Use NLTK to produce the n-grams for N = 2.
List the top 10 words for each coin.

Word Clouds

In this section, you will generate word clouds for each coin to summarize the news for each coin

In [59]:
from wordcloud import WordCloud

plt.style.use('seaborn-whitegrid')
import matplotlib as mpl
mpl.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [20.0, 10.0]

wc = WordCloud().generate(ethereum_text)
plt.imshow(wc)

Named Entity Recognition

In this section, you will build a named entity recognition model for both coins and visualize the tags using SpaCy.
